# spacebiz-frontend

My frontend uses the Vue.js framework, and is compiled for distribution by (npm's) vue-cli-service (see package.json)

I test the built app independently of the vue tools with (npm's) serve.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
